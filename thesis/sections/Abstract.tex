    Schools provide their students and teachers a very good infrastructure. 
    To ensure that it get's constantly improved, \ZELIA\ -- a real-time teaching room information system -- was developed.
    
    Informations such as the timetable of the room, the number of seats, the con\-nec\-tion options to the projector etc. should be managed and displayed in a way that is easily accessible and understandable.
    Furthermore, individual status information such as defective lamps in the rooms can be reported or bookings for studying groups and private tutoring lessons can be made.
    
    \ZELIA\ can be accessed through any internet-enabled device with a web browser. 
    There the users can enter a room number or scan it with the camera. 
    After entering this number, the information for the selected room will be displayed on the "Room information page". 
    From there, users can issue reservations and reports.
    
    \ZELIA\ is divided into the following parts:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Server -- provides the information
        \item Database -- stores the room data as well as report messages and booking entries
        \item Client -- allows end users to access \ZELIA\ through a web browser
    \end{itemize}
    
    These parts were implemented individually or in a team of two.
